# Web-Interface
This repo contains the Aurorastation WI.

The overall goal is to replace the patchwork of administrative interfaces that exist at the moment and provide additional features for the gameserver.

Right now the following features are available for you as a user:
* Create, comment on and complete contracts
* View your whitelists and warnings.

The following features are planned:
* A char editor to allow the editing of chars without the need to join the gameserver
* A messaging system that allows sending pda messages that are delivered when a char joins the game the next time.
* Library Access
* See issues for more informations
